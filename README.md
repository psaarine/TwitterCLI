# Twitter CLI

This is a CLI that I am developing in order to understand authentication protocols
of Twitter (and possibly other big tech). It is written in rust, since I dont want 
to use components that are "ready" and refined. Instead I want to understand all of the
functionality of an authentication library myself.
